# Data-Analysis-using-SQL-and-Power-BI

In this Data analysis and Visualization project using SQL and Power BI, the data used is from **AdventureWorks Sales Data**.

**Project Overview:**
1. The given data consists of 4 CSV files corresponding to Customer, Date, Product, Sales and 1 xlsx file corresponding to Budget.
2. I cleaned the tables by sorting and exporting only those columns which are needed for visualisation in PowerBI.
3. Once the cleaned data tables are exported as CSVs, I import the four CSVs and the Excel worksheet into PowerBI and link the tables together in the "Model" tab
4. Then I processed the data further using the "Transform data" in PowerBI for assigning columns different datatypes
5. Finally Visualized the data in 3 pages of Interactive dashboards for 2 main KPI's:
   
    a) Sales Overview/Summary
    b) Sales by Customer (KPI 1)
    c) Sales by Product  (KPI 2)
